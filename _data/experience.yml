    During my time at Simitive I worked as part of an agile team building our own in house web based software and
    also a large scale website for an international client. I gained experience working with a continuous integration
    workflow using tools such as <mark>Jenkins</mark> and working with Amazon Web Services for deployments. We built most
    of our software using <mark>Symfony</mark>, <mark>Backbone</mark>, <mark>Marionette</mark>, <mark>Vue</mark> and <mark>Vuex</mark>.

    For 6 months I was working on delivering a standalone web product for an international client that services over
    600,000 users. This has been built from the ground up using <mark>Symfony</mark> to provide a backend API and
    <mark>Backbone</mark> for the front end. I also gained a lot of experience with <mark>Elasticsearch</mark> to provide
    search functionality of millions of entities to the front end. During the project I spent time out of hours
    communicating with the client, performing deployments and providing support.

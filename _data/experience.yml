  description: |
    During my time at Simitive I worked as part of an agile team building our own in house web based software and
    also a large scale website for an international client. I gained experience working with a continuous integration
    workflow using tools such as <mark>Jenkins</mark> and working with Amazon Web Services for deployments. We built most
    of our software using <mark>Symfony</mark>, <mark>Backbone</mark>, <mark>Marionette</mark>, <mark>Vue</mark> and <mark>Vuex</mark>.

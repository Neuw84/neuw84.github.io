  I am a technology enthusiast that loves to learn and work with the latest technologies. Currently developing Big Data platforms for the Industry 4.0. at [Ikerlan](https://www.ikerlan.es/).
  
  Technologies that I use everyday:
    * ![SpringBoot](assets/spring-boot-logo.png){:height="33px"}
    * ![Spark](assets/spark-logo-hd.png){:height="40px"} 
    * ![Kafka](assets/kafka_logo.png){:height="36px"}
    * ![Mesos](assets/images.png){:height="30px"}
    * ![Kubernetes](assets/kubernetes-horizontal-color.png){:height="28x"}
    * ![MQTT](assets/MQTT.png){:height="22px"}
    
   Moreover, I like to give talks at conferences (e.g. [Big Data Spain](https://www.bigdataspain.org/)) or meetups (e.g. [DataBeers Eus](https://databeerseus.tumblr.com/)) when I have time &#9786;. The slides of my public talks can be seen at [SlideShare](https://es.slideshare.net/AngelCondeManjon/presentations)

  When I’m not sat at my desk I am very active and spend most of my time outdoors. I do a lot of sports, such as mountain biking, surfing, hiking, running or snowboarding. 
  
  Apart from doing sports, I like to watch TV series 🍿 and landscape photography.
